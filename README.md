# Logical Workbench with Clojure

This repository holds the work of a research project of the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (http://www.thm.de). It is a kind of playground for logical functions like parsing formulas and printing truth tables. It shall later replace the MPA (http://homepages.thm.de/~hg11260/mpa.html).
