/**
 * Provides the engine of the MNI macro processor mmp.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The class {@linkplain mmp.engine.Engine} contains the machine that processes macros.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The interface {@linkplain mmp.engine.EngineContext} gives the programmer of Java macros
 * access to the current state of the engine, i.e. {@linkplain mmp.engine.Input},
 * {@linkplain mmp.engine.Output}, {@linkplain mmp.engine.MacroRegistry} and the
 * {@linkplain mmp.engine.Settings}.
 * <br/><br/>
 * To program a Java macro, one must extend {@linkplain mmp.engine.Macro}, implementing
 * {@linkplain mmp.engine.Macro#call(java.util.List, EngineContext)} and respect the contract
 * of {@linkplain mmp.engine.Macro}.
