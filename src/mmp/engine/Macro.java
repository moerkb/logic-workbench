/**
 * Abstract class that must be extended by the provider of a Java macro.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Contract:
 * <ol>
 * 	 <li>Implement a constructor that uses the constructor of the super class
 *       with the appropriate value for needsParenthesis.
 *       <br/>
 *       Example:
 *       <br/>
 *       <code>
 *					public myMacro() {
 *       		<br/>
 *					&nbsp;&nbsp;super( false );
 *       		<br/>
 *					}
 *       <br/>
 *       </code>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Provide an implementation of 
 *     		{@linkplain mmp.engine.Macro#call(List, EngineContext)}. <br/>
 *       This method will be called from the engine during processing.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Sometimes several macros are closely related and one 
 *     	may wish to use a common implementation.
 *     To achieve this, one has to
 *       <br/>
 *     (a) provide a constructor with more than one parameter, 
 *     		<i>which must be of type String</i>,
 *       <br/>
 *     (b) override {@linkplain mmp.engine.Macro#getInstInfo()} 
 *     		to allow the mmp engine a call
 *       of the macro by reflection.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
