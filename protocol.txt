PROTOCOL

This file contains notes on what has been done and what needs to be done. It also 
holds important things to remember.

OPEN TASKS

- refactor basicfunctions such that no more namepaces are produced in the substitutions
- remove binary? function (tools.clj)
- flatten a tree from (and a (and b c)) to (and a b c)  (clojure.walk)
- extend grammar (!-> should be nimpl)

- tseitin tranformation
- dimacs format generator
- SAT4J wrapper
- distinguish between "human formula" ("A and B") and clojure code (and a b) automatically
- visualize formula tree graphically (instaparse/visualize) 

QUESTIONS

- "A <-> B <-> C" is different from WolframAlpha?
  
NOTES

- Basicfunctions must not be changed from macros to functions as cnf transformation
  would not work anymore (works with macroexpand).
