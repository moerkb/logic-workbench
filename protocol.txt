PROTOCOL

This file contains notes on what has been done and what needs to be done. It also 
holds important things to remember.

OPEN TASKS

- extend grammar (!-> should be nimpl)
- tseitin tests
- write protocol

- dimacs format generator
- SAT4J wrapper
- distinguish between "human formula" ("A and B") and clojure code (and a b) automatically
- visualize formula tree graphically (instaparse/visualize) 

QUESTIONS

- tseitin cnfs n-ary?
- "A <-> B <-> C" is different from WolframAlpha?
- equiv produces dnf?
  
NOTES

- Basicfunctions must not be changed from macros to functions as cnf transformation
  would not work anymore (works with macroexpand).
- Queens problem for (n = 2) (must be false for all):
	(a1 -> (!b1 and !a2 and !b2))
	and 
	(a2 -> (!b1 and !b2 and !a1))
	and
	(b1 -> (!a1 and !a2 and !b2))
	and
	(b2 -> (!a1 and !a2 and !b1))
	and
	(a1 or b1)
	and
	(a2 or b2)
	and
	(a1 or a2)
	and
	(b1 or b2)
